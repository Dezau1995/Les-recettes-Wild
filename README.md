## Project-1-Presentation

<h1>✨ Les Recettes Wild ✨</h1>

<p>
    First group project as web development students after one month studying code.
</p>

<p>
    This project was built by three people in a two weeks time.
</p>

<p>
   🍽️ Suggest easy-making receipes for students who doesn't have the time to cook.
</p>

<p>
    We had the idea of making a recipe site to help the wilders (people at the Wild Code School) to prepare their lunch more often.
</p>

<p>
   ❓ Why ? Because of lack of idea, time and desire from the everyone.
</p>

<p>
   ❗️ How ? With simple, fun and economic recipes.
</p>

<p>
   🛠️ The aim of the project was to develop technical skills on HTML, CSS and the basics of JS.
